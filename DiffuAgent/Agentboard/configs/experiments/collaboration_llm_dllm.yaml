# Agent Collaboration: LLM + dLLM
# Standard LLM as main agent, DiffusionLLM as auxiliary memory agent

# IMPORTANT: Must include BOTH main LLM (qwen3/ministral) AND auxiliary LLM (llada/dream/...)
# The config_merger only loads LLM configs that are explicitly listed here
llm: [qwen3, llada]

agent:
  preset: memory_exit_modest  # Use modest for dLLM auxiliary
  overrides:
    auxiliary_llm: llada

env: [alfworld_enhanced, scienceworld_enhanced, babyai_enhanced]

run:
  max_num_steps: 30
  wandb: false
  log_path: ${PROJECT_PATH}/outputs/collaboration_llm_dllm

# Usage:
#   Main agent (qwen3/ministral) generates actions
#   Auxiliary agent (llada/dream/fdllm/dvar) processes memory summaries
#
# Verification format recommendations:
#   - When using dLLM as auxiliary: use memory_exit_modest
#   - When using LLM as auxiliary: use memory_exit (strict)
