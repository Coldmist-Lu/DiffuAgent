"Observation: You move to the kitchen.",
"Thought: I need a container to hold water while I heat it.\nAction: open cupboard",
"Observation: The cupboard is now open.",
"Thought: The metal pot is ideal for boiling water.\nAction: pick up metal pot",
"Observation: You move the metal pot to the inventory.",
"Thought: Fill the pot with water.\nAction: activate sink",
"Observation: The sink is now activated.",
"Thought: Move the pot to the stove for heating.\nAction: move metal pot to stove",
"Observation: You move the metal pot to the stove.",
"Thought: Turn on the stove to start heating the water.\nAction: activate stove",
"Observation: The stove is now activated.",
"Thought: Confirm that the substance is water.\nAction: examine substance in metal pot",
"Observation: a substance called water",
"Thought: Steam indicates water has boiled.\nAction: examine steam",
"Observation: a substance called steam",
"Thought: Confirm the steam temperature.\nAction: use thermometer in inventory on steam",
"Observation: the thermometer measures a temperature of 107 degrees celsius",
"Thought: Waiting to ensure full phase transition.\nAction: wait1",
"Observation: You decide to wait for 1 iterations."
